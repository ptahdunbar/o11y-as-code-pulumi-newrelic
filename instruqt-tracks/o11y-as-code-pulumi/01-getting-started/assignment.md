=======================

In the root workspace directory, run the `make` command.
It will generate `.env` files for your applications.

```
make
vim apps/web-api/.env
vim apps/login-service/.env
```
üß™ Step 2: Add your New Relic License Keys
=======================

Using the Editor tab, update the `.env` files to add your `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` to each application.

.env file:
```
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=AABBCC
```
